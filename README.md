# Bayesian LSTM with MC Dropout (Uncertainty-Aware Forecasting)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network** with **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout** to perform **time series forecasting with uncertainty estimation**.  
Unlike traditional LSTMs that provide point forecasts, this approach also quantifies **predictive uncertainty** by leveraging dropout at inference time.

The model has been evaluated on **synthetic datasets** as well as **real-world data** (e.g., temperature and financial series).  
Results show that incorporating uncertainty improves decision-making in domains where **forecast confidence** is critical.
